Notepad 10k
================

Author: Ian P (ipavl)

Notepad 10k is a "Notepad" clone written in Visual Basic .NET. It
supports languages to be changed "on the fly" as of July 30th, 2013.
Sample languages are included in the source code for demonstration
purposes, though they may not be perfect as they were created using
Google Translate.

The included languages are:

* English
* French
* Spanish
* Finnish
* Japanese

Additional languages can be added by adding files to the "language"
directory in the same style as the sample ones. The program will
automatically load them on launch.

The source-code of the program is approximately 10kb without any
commented lines, prior to adding switching languages on the fly
support.
